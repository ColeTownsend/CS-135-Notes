* Everything in Python is an object with an assciated type.

```python
  type(6.0)
  >>>>> float
  
  type(None)
  <class null>
  
  type(())
  <class 'tuple'>
  
  int('5')
  5
  
  str('5')
  '5'
```

## Modules
* Files containing python definitions & statements
* it helps us logicallyrelate pieces of code
* ex: rain.py is a module
* Don't pollute te global namespace
    * to avoid name clashes, we hid them inside functions or other modules


```python
import goslate
// we can access all of the goslate variables, functions , etc now.
```

### Polar Coords          

* a,y --> (r, Theta)

## Functions

```python

import math
def polar(x, y):
    '''convert (x,y) into polar coordinates
       where the angle is in radians
    '''
    radius = math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
    angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    return(radius, angle)
    
```

### DocString
The first string that comes after the variable definition.

### Fxn Body
Where the actual function is defined and built out. Often ends in return. When you don't return a value it's more a **procedure**. This is called a **void function**.

### Conditonals
The test of a conditional statemnet must evaluate to type bool; this is often achieved using the equality operation `==`.

```python
def even(x):
    '''Test if x is even'''
    div = x%2
    if div == 0
        return True
    else
        return False
```

**Better**
```python
def even(x)
    return(x%2 == 0)
```
