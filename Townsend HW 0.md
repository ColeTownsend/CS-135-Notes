CS 135

1. I want to take CS 135 to increase my comfort with programming and to develop the concepts of functional, object-oriented programming. I think learning the skillset required to be a great programmer will make me a better thinker and problem solver. Also I took CS 109 and really got hooked on programming. It was the most fun I've ever had in a class here at Williams.

2. I have programmed before in python during Dwayne's CS 109 course last spring. We were mostly working with a library that he had already created but we still learned programming basics. I have also done some basic programming in javascript and that is ongoing. I work on the web a lot and recently picked up javascript after taking a Codecademy course.

3. I have not taken a math course at Williams. 

4. What is your programming language of choice? Why is that? I know that languages have their strengths and weaknesses depening on the situation

5. Just listening to some War on Drugs, I hear a lot of similarities to Cold Play and Fleetwood. I would suggest some Vancouver Sleep Clinic if you're into anything lower key. They sound a lot like Bon Iver. The War on Drugs seems like a more psychedelic rock-heavier Fleetwood Mac. If you haven't heard their Rumours album or really given it much of a listen I think you may really enjoy it. Lastly you may like Geographer. It's more upbeat indie rock.
