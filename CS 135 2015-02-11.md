Python can be run in two modes:

* Interactive
* Script


## Numbers

```python
a = complex(1,0)
# this creates a complex number where the first is a real number and the second is part of the imaginary number.

```

## Strings

Combining strings is called concatenation. Using `\n` you can create a new line. Using `r` is equivalent to `repr()` and it will change the string to a literal, printable string.

ex:
```python
a = r'look \nanewline'
a
'look \\anewline'
```
